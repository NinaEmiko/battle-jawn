# Battle-Jawn

This project started off as me trying to wrap my head around classes and how they can be utilized within a software program, and it spun out from there.

It is a turn-based, text-based battle game.

## Choose A Class

The first screen that the user is presented with gives them four classes to choose from:

- Healer
- Tank
- DPS
- Caster

Each class has their own weaknesses and strengths.

## Gameplay

### Enemies

After selecting which class the user would like to play as, the user is thrown into a battle with a random enemy:

- Spirit
- Orc
- Rogue
- Wolf

Each enemy has their own weaknesses and strengths.

### Player Moves

Players have the option to select from four possible moves(Not including hidden special moves):

- Normal Attack
- Heal/Consume Potion
- Strong Attack
- Run

### Log Box

Positioned beside the player's moves is a Log Box that tracks the moves that both the enemy and the user has used and how much damage has been done/how much health has been replenished/the success of a move.

## After Battle

After the battle the user will be returned to the Class Selection screen.
